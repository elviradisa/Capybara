        <h1>Capybara</h1>
        <!--MY OWN THOUGHTS-->
        <p>The Capybara has really grown on me as of lately. I see it on every social media platform, probably because the algorithm has caught up on me.<br>
        WhatÂ´s fascinating about them is their size, at first glanse you might compare them to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig" target="_blank" title="Open Guinea pig Wikipedia">Guinea Pig</a>, but they are in fact almost the size of a real pig.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>

            <!--BODY AND HAIR-->
